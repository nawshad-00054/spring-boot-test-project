Child Task List for System Design:
1. Identify system requirements:
   - Analyze user needs and gather functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Prioritize requirements and identify any conflicting or ambiguous requirements.
2. Define system architecture:
   - Identify the main components and subsystems of the system.
   - Determine the interactions and dependencies between the components.
   - Design the overall system structure and its relationship with external systems.
3. Design system interfaces:
   - Define the interfaces between the system and external systems or modules.
   - Specify the methods, protocols, and data formats for data exchange.
   - Design user interfaces and interaction flows.
4. Determine system behavior:
   - Define the system's response to different inputs and events.
   - Specify the control flow and decision-making processes.
   - Design error handling and exception management mechanisms.
5. Consider security measures:
   - Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities.
   - Design authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Define data encryption and secure communication protocols.
Child Task List for Database Design:
1. Gather requirements for data storage and access:
   - Identify the data entities and their attributes.
   - Determine the relationships between entities.
   - Define the data integrity and validation rules.
2. Design data model:
   - Identify the entities, attributes, and relationships of the system's data.
   - Define the database schema and data storage mechanisms.
   - Determine data access and retrieval strategies.
3. Design the conceptual data model:
   - Create an entity-relationship (ER) diagram representing the data entities and relationships.
   - Refine the ER diagram based on feedback and requirements.
4. Normalize the data model:
   - Apply normalization techniques to ensure data integrity and minimize redundancy.
   - Identify functional dependencies and eliminate data anomalies.
5. Design the logical data model:
   - Convert the conceptual data model into a logical model using a relational data model.
   - Specify the tables, attributes, and primary/foreign key relationships.
6. Optimize the data model:
   - Analyze the expected data volume and usage patterns.
   - Optimize the table structures and indexing for efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
Child Task List for Codebase Design:
1. Define the code organization and structure:
   - Determine the overall codebase structure, such as modules, packages, or layers.
   - Define naming conventions and guidelines for code organization.
2. Design the application architecture:
   - Identify the main components and their responsibilities.
   - Determine the interactions and dependencies between components.
   - Choose appropriate design patterns and architectural styles.
3. Define class and function design:
   - Design classes and their attributes and methods.
   - Specify function signatures, input/output parameters, and responsibilities.
4. Address code reusability and modularity:
   - Identify opportunities for code reuse.
   - Design reusable modules or libraries.
   - Implement code modularity to improve maintainability and extensibility.
5. Design error handling and exception management:
   - Define error handling mechanisms, including exception types and error messages.
   - Design a consistent approach for logging and reporting errors.
6. Consider code performance and optimization:
   - Identify performance bottlenecks and critical code sections.
   - Optimize algorithms and data structures.
   - Consider caching, concurrency, and resource management techniques.
7. Incorporate coding best practices and standards:
   - Follow coding conventions and style guidelines.
   - Apply design principles, such as SOLID and DRY.
   - Use appropriate design patterns and idiomatic coding practices.
8. Document the codebase design:
   - Provide code documentation, such as comments, inline documentation, or code annotations.
   - Document code dependencies, interfaces, and interactions.
